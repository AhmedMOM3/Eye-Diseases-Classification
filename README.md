# 🧠 Eye Diseases Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on classifying various **eye diseases from medical images** using deep learning. 
The goal is to support early clinical diagnosis by providing an automated and accurate image-based system.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Eye diseases can lead to vision loss if not detected early. With computer vision models, we analyze retina / cornea images and classify them into predefined categories.

This project:

- Loads and preprocesses a dataset of eye disease images
- Trains an EfficientNetV2-S model using transfer learning
- Evaluates performance using accuracy

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes multiple types of eye conditions such as:

- Cataract
- Glaucoma
- Normal
- Diabetic Retinopathy
